                    The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) began gaining traction in 2010, envisioning a world where everyday objects are connected to the internet and can communicate with each other. This connectivity promised to create smarter and more efficient environments, from homes and cities to industrial systems. Early IoT applications included smart thermostats, security systems, and wearable health monitors.

                        The potential for IoT to revolutionize various sectors, such as healthcare, agriculture, and transportation, was increasingly recognized. This period saw the development of standards and protocols to facilitate the growth of IoT ecosystems, laying the groundwork for the interconnected world that would continue to expand in the following decade.
